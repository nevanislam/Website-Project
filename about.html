      The Looney Tunes Show is an American animated sitcom produced by Warner
      Bros. Animation that ran from May 3, 2011, through August 31, 2014, on
      Cartoon Network. The series consists of two seasons, each containing 26
      episodes, and features characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie
      Melodies theatrical cartoon shorts updated for the 21st century.
      Initially, the series received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the
      visual style, humor, portrayal of the characters, and voice acting, but
      criticized its direction, its divergences from its source material, its
      lack of slapstick, and its changes to the characters' designs and
      personalities.
